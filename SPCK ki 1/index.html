        Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween
        2023 will occur on Tuesday, October 31. The tradition originated with
        the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would light bonfires
        and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope
        Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon,
        All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The
        evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over
        time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities like trick-or-treating,
        carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating
        treats.

      <p class="content">
        Halloween's origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain
        (pronounced sow-in). The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the
        area that is now Ireland, the United Kingdom and northern France,
        celebrated their new year on November 1. This day marked the end of
        summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, a
        time of year that was often associated with human death. Celts believed
        that on the night before the new year, the boundary between the worlds
        of the living and the dead became blurred. On the night of October 31
        they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of the
        dead returned to earth.

      <h3 class="title-information">History of Jack O'Lanterns</h3>
      <p class="content">
        People have been making Jack O'Lanterns at Halloween for centuries. The
        practice originated from an Irish myth about a man nicknamed “Stingy
        Jack.” According to the story, Stingy Jack invited the Devil to have a
        drink with him. True to his name, Stingy Jack didn't want to pay for his
        drink, so he convinced the Devil to turn himself into a coin that Jack
        could use to buy their drinks. Once the Devil did so, Jack decided to
        keep the money and put it into his pocket next to a silver cross, which
        prevented the Devil from changing back into his original form.
        Jack eventually freed the Devil, under the condition that he would not
        bother Jack for one year and that, should Jack die, he would not claim
        his soul. The next year, Jack again tricked the Devil into climbing into
        a tree to pick a piece of fruit. While he was up in the tree, Jack
        carved a sign of the cross into the tree's bark so that the Devil could
        not come down until the Devil promised Jack not to bother him for ten
        more years.
        Soon after, Jack died. As the legend goes, God would not allow such an
        unsavory figure into heaven. The Devil, upset by the trick Jack had
        played on him and keeping his word not to claim his soul, would not
        allow Jack into hell. He sent Jack off into the dark night with only a
        burning coal to light his way. Jack put the coal into a carved-out
        turnip and has been roaming the Earth with it ever since. The Irish
        began to refer to this ghostly figure as “Jack of the Lantern,” and
        then, simply “Jack O'Lantern.”

        <p class="content">
          Kids still love to dress up in creative costumes to traipse around the
          neighborhood collecting treats from as many houses as possible.
          It can be especially fun when adults also get into the spirit of
          things. Yards that are decorated in fun or spooky ways create the
          right environment. Scary music coming from a house gives kids a sense
          of trepidation that dares them to get closer to the desired treat. And
          when adults get dressed up in costumes, too, there is definitely a
          feeling of camaraderie among the family and neighbors.

        <p class="content">
          Carving a jack-o-lantern originated with the Irish and more
          specifically, a devious man named Stingy Jack. The myth is that when
          he died he wasn't accepted into either heaven or hell and wandered on
          earth with only a lump of coal to light his way, which he placed in a
          hollowed-out turnip. As the myth goes on, Jack roams the earth scaring
          children.
